# migrate-state.sh — one-shot migration from the v0.4.0–v0.4.<n-1>
# token-samples layout to the v0.4.x+ per-project layout.
#
# v0.4.0 through v0.4.<n-1> stored token-sample JSONL files at:
#   state/token-samples/<projectHash>/<sessionId>.jsonl
#
# v0.4.x+ moves the per-session file up one level (no `token-samples/`
# intermediate) to make per-project isolation uniform across all
# runtime state files (cache.json, diagnostics.jsonl, sample jsonl):
#   state/<projectHash>/<sessionId>.jsonl
#
# Why a separate tool (not auto-migration):
#   - Auto-migration would add 3-10ms IO to every statusline tick.
#   - Sample data is time-decaying — a week-old sample contributes
#     little to m_token5h / m_token7d. Most users are better off
#     re-accumulating from a clean slate.
#   - `scripts/uninstall.sh` already wipes the entire state/ tree
#     on uninstall, so users who don't care about preserving
#     history have an easy "reset to clean" path: uninstall, then
#     reinstall.
#
# This script moves the per-session files using `mv -n` (no-clobber)
# so it is safe to re-run after a partial migration. It does NOT
# touch the legacy top-level `state/cache.json` or
# `state/diagnostics.jsonl` — those files have no project
# information and cannot be migrated to the per-project layout
# automatically. They will simply be ignored by the new code paths.
#
# Usage:
#   migrate-state.sh            # perform the migration
#   migrate-state.sh --dry-run  # print what would be moved, change nothing
#   migrate-state.sh -h | --help
#
# Portable: Linux, macOS, Git Bash on Windows. Never reads
# ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN. No network access. Idempotent.
