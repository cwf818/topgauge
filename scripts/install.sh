#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — install / uninstall / restore the topgauge-cc (ToPGauge-CC)
# wrapper into Claude Code's settings.json.
#
# Usage:
#   install.sh                       # install at user-level (default)
#   install.sh --project             # install at project-level (cwd)
#   install.sh --restore [--project] # restore settings.json from .bak.<ts>
#   install.sh --uninstall [--project] # remove wrapper, restore previous statusLine
#   install.sh --dry-run [...]       # print actions, change nothing
#
# Behavior:
#   - Idempotent: re-running on an already-managed statusLine is a no-op.
#   - If a non-managed statusLine is found, the current settings.json is backed
#     up to settings.json.bak.<ISO-timestamp>, and the original statusLine
#     command is preserved in <claude-root>/plugins/topgauge-cc/state/upstream-cmd.sh
#     (sibling of config.json) so the wrapper can invoke it as the upstream.
#     This location is STABLE across /plugin install rolls — the per-version
#     cache dir can come and go, but the state dir is permanent.
#   - Settings are rewritten via scripts/lib/edit-settings.js, which preserves
#     the original line ending (CRLF on Windows, LF elsewhere).
#   - v0.7.0: when an old `plugins/tokenplan-usage-hud/state/` directory exists
#     (from a pre-rename install) and the new location does not, its contents
#     are copied into the new location so existing token-sample history,
#     diagnostics logs, preserved upstream command, etc. follow the user.
#
# Portable: Linux, macOS, Git Bash on Windows.
